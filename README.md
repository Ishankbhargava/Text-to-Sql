# Text-to-Sql
 A Text-to-SQL LLM Project aims to convert natural language queries into SQL statements using a Large Language Model (LLM). This enables users to retrieve structured data from databases without writing SQL manually, making data access more intuitive.
The project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning to translate user queries into SQL. It is useful for non-technical users who need database access without SQL knowledge.

Key Features
Natural Language Querying: Users can ask questions in plain English, such as "Show me all orders from last month."
SQL Generation: The model translates the query into SQL, e.g.,
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH);
Database Schema Awareness: The system understands database structures and adjusts queries accordingly.
Error Handling: Provides feedback if the query is ambiguous or invalid.
Multi-Database Support: Works with MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.
Tech Stack
LLM Models: OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, or open-source models like Llama/CodeLlama.
Frameworks: LangChain, Hugging Face Transformers.
Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.
Backend: FastAPI, Flask, or Node.js.
Frontend: React, Vue, or a chatbot interface.
Challenges
Handling complex joins and subqueries.
Adapting to different database schemas dynamically.
Optimizing performance for large databases.
Use Cases
Business Intelligence: Data analysis without SQL expertise.
Customer Support: Querying databases for troubleshooting.
Education: Teaching SQL through natural language.
